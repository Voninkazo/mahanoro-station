# Graded Project - Mahanoro Station

![Design preview for the Mahanoro station coding challenge](./design/1.png)

In my project I have got few pages and each of them contains all of the steps a user needs to follow when booking trips.

I have managed to pck seat sand get the total price of the seats I picked but I couldn't stop the state from generating to all of the trips that exist.

I also coulnd't finish updating the isAvailabel state

The hardest thing was to handle all of the state
I think I would like a lot of trainings about redux and how it works really
